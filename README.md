### Long-read sequencing expression data

Deep long-read brain sequencing data were obtained from a previous experiment in the lab. Details about the data can be found at: https://github.com/UK-SBCoA-EbbertLab/brain_cDNA_discovery

Long-read sequencing data from 9 tissues were obtained from GTEx. Fastq files were downloaded and re-analyzed using our NextFlow pipeline. For more details see the original publication with this data: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35922509/


### ENSEMBL annotations

Instructions on how to retrieve the ENSEMBL annotations and related documentation can be found under: `./references/`

### Nextflow Pipeline 

Fastq data were analyzed using our in-house Nanopore cDNA/RNA sequencing Nextflow pipeline. Documntation can be found under: `./nextflow_pipeline/`
